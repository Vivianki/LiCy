## Synopsis

Final project for Computer Engineering at University Of São Paulo.
PHY I implementation of IEEE 802.15.7 Li-Fi standard. Mostly done in VHDL for Cyclone IV FPGA.

## Motivation

Li-Fi applications are varied as a result of its key features, such as 
* directional lighting, 
* energy efficiency, 
* intrinsic security, 
* high data rate capability, 
* signal blocking by walls and 
* integrated networking capability.
Therefore it has a various applications in: 
* Security,
* Dense urban environments, 
* Electromagnetic interference sensitive environments,
* Safety environments,
* Intelligent transportation systems,
* Indoor navigation,
* Sensitive data

## Tests

Testing is done using VHDL Test Bench files.
